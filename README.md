# Rails Active Record Migrations + Validations Exercise
 We just learned about Rails Model migrations and validations. Let's get some more practice on what we covered by adding onto the `models_example` app we just built during the lesson. You can follow along with the lesson plan to complete the steps below.
 
 
1.  Create a `Car` model that has `make`, `model`, `year`, `moonroof`, `dealership` fields. Remember to designate the correct data type for each!

2. Run the command that will update our 	`schema.rb` and add the new model to our database.

3. Oops, we forgot to add a `color` field to `Car`. Go ahead and generate a migration to add that field to our schema.

4. We really don't care where we bought our vehicle so let's remove the `dealership` field from our schema.

5. Add validations to require that all of our fields are present in order for a record to be persisted to the database. 

6. Add a validation that `year` contains 4 digits and provide an error message if the year is too short.

7. Generate a migration that will rename the `moonroof` field to `sunroof`.

8. Enter `rails console` and add 4 cars to your database.

9. Update the color of the first `Car` in your database.

10. Delete the 3rd `Car` in your database.

###BONUS

Set up a relationship between `User` and `Car` where a car `belongs_to` a User and a User `has_many` cars. What steps are required?
